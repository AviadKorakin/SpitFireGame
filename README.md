## üõ†Ô∏è Code Highlights

### Gravity Simulation
The Spitfire Flight Simulator includes a gravity feature that dynamically pulls the plane towards the ground based on altitude. The force adjusts proportionally to height, adding realism as players navigate challenging terrains. Additionally, the game supports **3D spatial audio**, allowing players to experience sounds from different directions and depths for heightened immersion.

```csharp
private void ApplyGravityIfNeeded()
{
    if (transform.position.y > 2.5f)
    {
        transform.position += Vector3.down * gravity * Time.deltaTime * ((transform.position.y + 800f) / 800f);
        // simulating gravity per height
    }
}
```

### Missile Mechanics
Missiles are launched from the Spitfire and seek out balloon targets, adding to the score on impact:
```csharp
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
{
    if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Balloon"))
    {
        flightSimulator.StopShootSound();
        PlayHitSound();
        DisableMissile();
        other.gameObject.SetActive(false);
        flightSimulator.IncreaseScore(1);
        StartCoroutine(DestroyAfterSound());
    }
}
```

### Plane Movement & Control
Realistic control inputs for pitch, yaw, and roll create an authentic flying experience:
```csharp
private void HandleRotationInput()
{
    float yaw = Input.GetAxis("Yaw") * currentSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
    float pitch = Input.GetAxis("Pitch") * currentSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
    float roll = Input.GetAxis("Roll") * currentSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
    transform.Rotate(pitch, yaw, roll);
}
```
